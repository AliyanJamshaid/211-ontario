Systemic/institutional abuse includes rules and practices developed for an apparently neutral purpose, but that disproportionately harm older adults. For example, funding long term care homes more than home care disproportionately leads to institutionalization of older adults. </span><span style=\"background-color: unset; font-size: 10pt; text-align: inherit; color: rgba(var(--color-sf-on-surface));\">Staffing shortages in care facilities can lead to systemic neglect. </span></li><li><b style=\"background-color: unset; font-size: 10pt; text-align: inherit; color: rgba(var(--color-sf-on-surface));\">Overlap among types of abuse - example: home takeover </b><span style=\"background-color: unset; font-size: 10pt; text-align: inherit; color: rgba(var(--color-sf-on-surface));\">An older adult can experience more than one type of abuse at the same time. For example, older adults sometimes experience a home takeover in which an older adult is forced to accommodate unwanted guests in their home. A home takeover is a form of financial abuse because the older adult has lost control of their home. However, a home takeover is also a form of emotional abuse because the older adult feels powerless to force the unwanted guests to leave due to threats of harm/intimidation or out of fear that they will lose their relationship with the friend/family member who is the unwanted guest. </span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>Emergencies:</strong></span></p><ul>\t<li style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">If the situation is an emergency and you believe that the person for whom you are concerned is at risk, call 9-1-1.</span></li>\t<li style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">The Seniors Assistance Team, OPP ask you to call the police (OPP detachment/local police) if you suspect or know of any elder abuse</span></li>\t<li style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Seniors crime stoppers 1-800-222-8477, </span><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><a href=\"http://www.crimestopperssdm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Crime Stoppers</a></span></li></ul><p><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><strong>To report abuse</strong></span></p><ul>\t<li style=\"font-size: 10pt;\"><span style=\"font-size: 10pt;\">Senior's Safety Line - 1-866-299-1011. 24 hours a day, seven days a week, in over 150 languages.

Baby &amp; Toddler Drop-in gives parents/caregivers and children an opportunity to explore, engage, and express themselves together which helps strengthen the bond between adult and child. There are many creative activities, sensory and early literacy experiences to choose from within the room and a registered Early Childhood Educator in a co-learner role with the adults and children participating.</p>\n<p><strong>Rainbow Connections (Ages 0-6) </strong>This monthly evening drop-in welcomes 2SLGBTQIA+ families and allies to play with their children and connect with our educators in a supportive, inclusive space. Older siblings are welcome and snacks will be provided.</p>\n<p><strong>*Please see the EarlyON program schedules for Viola Public School and 410 Bronte Street South locations at website: <a href=\"https://mcrc.on.ca/earlyonschedule/\" target=\"_blank\">www.mcrc.on.ca</a> for additional programs</strong></p>",
